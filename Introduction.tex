\title{Applied Data Science Capstone Final Project}
\subtitle{Sports Facilities in Thessaloniki, Greece}
\author{Charalampos Kokkalis}
\maketitle 

\section*{Introduction/Business Plan}
For the final project of the Applied Data Science Capstone, and since we were given the choice of our topic, I decided to do something related to my hometown, Thessaloniki, Greece, and to my main hobby, basketball (and sports in general). In the recent years, I have faced the challenge of finding proper sports facilities, in order to exercise, many times. Although there has been some movement in the market, there is still a great shortage of centers for sports, given the high demand due to the city being famous for its sports teams and thus motivating all its citizens to spend time trying different sports.

\section*{Aim of the Analysis}
The aim of the following analysis is to find suggested sub-areas in the city of Thessaloniki where it would be worth building sports facilities. The outcome of this analysis would be useful both to the Municipality, which could make public sports facilities, and to individuals looking to start their own businesses in the market.

\section*{Data Used}
\begin{itemize}
\item {To get access to a map of the city, I used the folium Python library.}
\item {To search for sports facilities in the area, I used the Foursquare API.}

\end{itemize}
